Abstract class and interface both are used for achieving abstraction in java.

Abstract class :
	1.It has abstract keyword. 
	2.It may or may not have abstract methods.
	3.When we want nobody to create object of a class, we prefer making that class
	as abstract class. We can not instantiate object for abstract class.
	4.Abstract class should have child otherwise it is meaningless.
	5.Empty abstract class is also valid .
	6.Child class of abstract class should override all abstract methods of abstract
	class otherwise we need to make that child class as abstract class.
	7.It can have final, static, non final, non static variables.
	8.We can not create object of abstracted class with reference variable of 
	  same abstracted class.

eg.

public abstract class Student {

	final String name ="Shubham";
	String address ;
	
	public Student( String address) {
		super();
		this.address = address;
	}
	
	abstract double getPercentage( );
	
	void funX(){
	
	}
}

public class ScienceStudent extends Student {
	
	int phisicsMarks;
	int chemistryMarks;
	int mathsMarks;

	public ScienceStudent(String name, String address) {
		super(name, address);
		// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
		this.name = name;
		this.address= address;
	}
	
	@Override
	double getPercentage() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		double percentage = (double) (phisicsMarks+chemistryMarks+mathsMarks)/3;
		return percentage;
	}

}


Interface :
1.Interface provides 100% abstraction.
2.Interface is like contract, whichever class implements it,
3.it should implement all the overridden methods.
4.An Interface has only static and final variables.
5.Members of a Java interface are public by default.
6.by default methods in interface are "public abstract".
7. Child of interface should be abstract class or all methods from interface
 should be overriden
8. We can have default and static methods in interface.
9. Interface can be extended by another interface but can not be implemented.

eg.
public interface Hotel {
	void chickenBiryani();
	void masalaDosa();
}

public class TajHotel implements Hotel {

	@Override
	public void chickenBiryani() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("TajHotel chicken biryani");
	}

	@Override
	public void masalaDosa() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("TajHotel masaladosa");
	}
	
	public void welcomeDrink(){
		System.out.println("Welcome Drink from the TajHotel");
	}

}
